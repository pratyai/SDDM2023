# Toward Practical SDDM Linear Equation Solvers: Experimental Evaluation

Our paper [Toward Practical SDDM Linear Equation Solvers (working title, TODO) (arXiv link, TODO)](https://example.com/) introduces a new Laplacian linear equation solver, ApproxChol, which is part of the [Laplacians.jl](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl/) package.

The paper contains a suite of experiments comparing our solver to several other SDDM linear equation solvers.
Our experiments and results are described in the [paper (arXiv link, TODO)](https://example.com/).

This repository provides the test suite code we used to run our experiments. The accompanying website is intended to help readers understand and reproduce our experiments on SDDM linear equation solvers.

Read our [tutorial](Tutorial.md) to get started.

<!-- *TODO* move the code from lapsolveeval repo to here -->
